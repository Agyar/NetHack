-- fix src/objects.c stats consistency

-- remove include/you.h useless data

-- finish src/role.c elder consistency

-- killing a ghost give its knowledge to elder
   -- elder have a chance of becoming mad each time he does this

-- as the elder go further in the game, its body starts to fall apart 
   -- cannot be healed by an unicorn horn
   -- the game must be a run against the time
   -- the class must be powerfull enough to be able to win before dying

-- create a quest artifact
   -- idea : when invoked, artifact may teleport player to a RANDOM lvl 
             with bones file.
